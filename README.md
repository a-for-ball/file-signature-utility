# File Signature Utility
## Simple Description
This is a simple utility to check for the type of file based on it's hex signature. Based on the file signatures available at [Gary Kessler's website](https://www.garykessler.net/library/file_sigs.html).
It is a useful tool in digital forensics to check for what type of file is present if no apparent extension is visible.
